If you wish to contact me, I am most accessible via email.  You can construct
my email address by applying the following steps:

1. Insert an `@` between my first and surname (found at the top of the page).
2. Append `.uk`.

Alternatively, if you have a GitHub account, you can view my email address on
my profile there.
