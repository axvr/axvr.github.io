I'm a professional software engineer attempting to discover how to create
better software.  Largely unknown, this digital world we are building and
depend upon, is extremely fragile, complex and driven by fads.  I believe we
can do better; the field is young and there is much to be discovered.

A tiny subset of the topics that interest me are:

- The design and creation of safe, effective and simple software systems.
- Expression of ideas using a computer, particularly through programming
  languages and environments.
- Human-computer interaction.
- Computer and computer science history.
