I'm a software engineer attempting to discover how to create better computer
and software systems.  Here you will find things related to the following
topics:

- the design/creation of safe, secure, effective and simple software systems;
- experimentation and expression using computers (e.g. programming languages);
- the history of computers and computer science; and
- generally having fun with computation.
