There are lots of great, classic computing books which are now sadly out of
print and difficult to get physical copies of.  However you can still find many
of them archived in various places across the web.  Luckily sites like [LuLu][]
can print one-off copies of books for relatively little money.  All you need is
a PDF of the book and a replacement cover; exactly what this page contains.


#### _On Lisp_ by Paul Graham

[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com)'s [_On Lisp_](http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
is a Lisp classic dedicated to macros and other advanced programming techniques.

You will need these files to print a _near identical_ "perfect paperback"
reproduction of _On Lisp_ through [LuLu][]:

- Book content, [PDF](on_lisp_content.pdf).
- Book cover, [PDF](on_lisp_cover.pdf).  (You can ignore the slight
  imperfection on the right edge, it will be chopped off when they cut the book
  down to size.)


**Attribution**

This has been made possible thanks to the great effort of several people:

- 1993: [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com) published _On Lisp_ through Prentice Hall.
- 2002: Paul Graham regained copyright and published a [free download](http://paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html)
  of _On Lisp_ (with missing diagrams).
- 2010: Ramakrishnan created scans of the [missing diagrams](https://web.archive.org/web/20100302002206/http://www.zerobeat.in/wiki/doku.php?id=onlisp_missing_figures).
- 2015: David Drysdale remade the diagrams and created a
  [complete PDF](https://www.lurklurk.org/onlisp/onlisp.html) of the book.
  (The cover he created was fairly low quality and no longer works on LuLu.)
- 2021: Alex Vear (me) recreated a near perfect reproduction of the original
  cover that works on LuLu.
