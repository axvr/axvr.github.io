There are lots of great, classic computing books which are now sadly out of
print and difficult to get physical copies of.  However you can still find many
of them archived in various places across the web and sites like [LuLu][] can
print one-off books for very little money.  All you need is a PDF of the book
and the cover; exactly what this page contains.


### _On Lisp_ by Paul Graham

[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com)'s [_On Lisp_](http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
is an excellent Lisp book dedicated to macros, closures and other advanced
programming techniques.

You will need these files to print a _near identical_ "perfect paperback"
reproduction of _On Lisp_ through [LuLu][]:

- Book content, [PDF](on_lisp_content.pdf).
- Book cover, [PDF](on_lisp_cover.pdf).<sup>1</sup>

<p class="footnote">
\[1\] The imperfection on the right edge will be chopped off when the book is
cut to size.

#### Attribution

This has been made possible thanks to the great effort of several people:

- 1993: [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com) published _On Lisp_ through Prentice Hall.
- 2002: Paul Graham regained copyright and published a [free download](http://paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html)
  of _On Lisp_ (with missing diagrams).
- 2010: Ramakrishnan created scans of the [missing diagrams](https://web.archive.org/web/20100302002206/http://www.zerobeat.in/wiki/doku.php?id=onlisp_missing_figures).
- 2015: David Drysdale created SVGs of the diagrams from the scans and built a
  [complete PDF](https://www.lurklurk.org/onlisp/onlisp.html) of the book.
  (Unfortunately the cover he created was fairly low-quality and no longer works with LuLu.)
- 2021: Alex Vear (me) created a high-quality, near identical reproduction of
  the original cover that works on LuLu.
